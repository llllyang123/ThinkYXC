Based on thinkphp6 and the high efficiency and high performance of xinopph, the CMS system is optimized and reconstructed
The back end is based on PHP + MYSQL, and the front end is based on layui + jQuery 3.1, which is a general CMS system.
At present, it is in the beta version, updating and fixing bugs irregularly
Build on the latest version of thinkphpv6.0! The pursuit of the ultimate at the same time for PHP name! Who says PHP is not the best language in the world?!
The performance is far better than that of similar products on the market. We will continue to upgrade and optimize in the later stage to improve the user experience by using the xino system for reference! Support plug-in mechanism, quickly expand the system.
There are many products developed on the market based on thinkph5, but only a few based on thinkp6. Therefore, a set of system is developed from the heart. Simplify while pursuing the ultimate performance, later will add more high-performance features and upgrade Oh!

Very pure based on thinkphp6, no redundant library, greatly reduce the coupling at the same time explore deeper performance!
Almost all products of the same type in the market have developed their own library separately, which not only improves the coupling degree, but also reduces the performance. Just think about it: I only need to load a home page, but I need to load the library of ThinkPHP, as well as the library files developed by the developers themselves. When there are many functions, I need to load the library files of other functions. Think about how cumbersome it is! How can the performance be fast!
Its name is convenient and rapid development, but in fact there are too many non-standard standards. We should not only learn to adapt to the standard of ThinkPHP, but also learn the code standard of the system we use. While the learning cost is increased, a lot of energy is wasted.
It's like a mobile phone manufacturer racking his brains to make the mobile phone thin, but you give it a shell more than one centimeter thick and tell the consumer that it's your new product
